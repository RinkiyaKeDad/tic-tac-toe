# Modern Tic-Tac-Toe
Hey wanderer! This was one of my first web-dev projects. Created a tic-tac-toe game using vanilla JS (good ol' days) and some Bootstrap (to make my life easy :P). Added two-player mode and a single-player mode where you can choose whether to go X or O first. Fun fact implemented the MiniMax algorithm so you can't beat the computer (machines shall rule us!). Had a lot of fun making it. Letting this repo remain public in the hopes that someone learns from my code :))
